<hr>
<p>DSM (Distributed Shared Memory) is a system for data sharing and
synchronization among SMA 
computers over the network.  Originally modeled on the <a
href="http://sma-www.cfa.harvard.edu/private/memos/141/141.html">Reflective
Memory</a> system used between hal9000 and the antenna computers, DSM
has grown beyond its initial design to provide additional features.</p>

<hr><a name="features"><h2>Summary of Features</h2></a>
<p><b>Multi-platform</b> - At this writing, DSM runs on PowerPC LynxOS
and x86 Linux.  If necessary, it will be ported to other platforms.</p>

<p><b>Data Types</b> - DSM allows the sharing of several data types:
<ul>
<li>byte (8 bits)
<li>short integer (16 bits)
<li>long integer (32 bits)
<li>single-precision floating point (32 bits)
<li>double-precision floating point (64 bits)
<li>character strings, arbitrary length
<li>arrays of the above types
<li>composite structures: arbitrary groups of the above types
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Synchronization</b> - DSM provides the ability for clients to
sleep while waiting for data to change anywhere in the DSM system.</p>

<p><b>Timestamping</b> - All DSM shared data are marked with the time
they most recently changed.</p>

<p><b>Robust</b> - Server and clients recover automatically and
transparently from most fault conditions.  Clients survive
restarts of the server.  Individual server restarts do not cause data
loss.</p>



<hr><a name="architecture"><h2>System Architecture</h2></a>
<p>DSM uses Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) over TCP for communications
both between client and server within a host computer, and between
servers on different hosts.  The DSM server almost completely decouples
the local client services from the host-to-host synchronization
procedure.  This arrangement protects clients from latencies due to
problems with the network, remote hosts, and remote DSM servers.  Note
that this means clients do not know when or even if a remote
synchronization succeeded.  In practice this has not been a problem, and
even if it is, the timestamp and synchronization facilities allow
client programs to take this uncertainty into account when it matters.</p>

<hr>
<a name="config"><h2>Configuration</h2></a>
<h3>Server startup</h3>
<p>The server is in <tt>$COMMONBIN/dsm</tt> and has two optional
command-line switches:
<ul>
<li><tt>-v</tt> activates diagnostic output to <tt>stderr</tt>; the
server throughtput will be dramatically reduced in this mode, so it is
used only for debugging
<li><tt>-f [configuration file path]</tt> specifies the location of the
configuration file
</ul>
On startup, the server tries to read the configuration file.  If the
<tt>-f</tt> command line option is provided, it uses the specified file
path.  If not, it uses the value of the environment variable
<tt>DSM_ALLOCATION_FILE</tt>.  If there is no such variable, it uses
<tt>/global/dsm/dsm_allocation</tt>.

<h3>Allocation file</h3>
<p>
The data sharing configuration for DSM is described in the allocation
file.  When the file is modified, it must be processed into a form which
DSM can read. This is done by typing "<tt>make allocation</tt>" in the
DSM directory <tt>$GLOBAL/dsm</tt>.  Then, to activate the changes, the
DSM program must be restarted on all of the systems.</p>

<p>
The allocation file may contain four types of directives: class
definitions, allocations, structure definitions, and share definitions.
It may also contain comments, indicated with pound ("#") characters.

<h4>class definitions</h4>
Class definitions simply define groups of computers for later use in
share definitions.  A class definition consists of the word "class", the
name of the class, and a comma-separated list of resolvable host
names. Example: to define two classes, CL1 and CL2, each containing two
host names, write
<pre>
class  CL1  host1,host2
class  CL2  host3,host4
</pre>


<h4>allocations</h4>
Allocation directives are used in structure definitions and share
definitions to specify the actual data to be shared.  Allocation names
include several "fields":
<p>
<tt>name_type</tt>   or   <tt>name_Vm_..._type</tt>
<p>
<tt>name</tt> is a descriptive name (may contain additional underscores).<br>
<tt>type</tt> is a code describing the data type:<br>
<pre>
   B  = integer, 8 bit                (1 byte)
   S  = integer, 16 bit               (2 bytes)
   L  = integer, 32 bit               (4 bytes)
   F  = IEEE floating point, 32 bit   (4 bytes)
   D  = IEEE floating point, 64 bit   (8 bytes)
   Cn = character array (string) of length n
   X  = composite structure
</pre>

Any code except "X" may be preceded by one or more sequences of
"Vm" to specify an array.

<p>
Examples:
<pre>
 DSM_CRATE_VAL1_F          : a 4-byte float
 DSM_HAL_FILE_NAME_C50     : a 50 character string
 DSM_DDS_DATA_V10_S        : an array of 10 16-bit integers
 DSM_MRG_FDATA_V128_V128_D : a 128x128 array of 64-bit floating point values
 DSM_CORR_PKT_X            : a structure previously defined elsewhere
</pre>

Names are case-sensitive, and may not be longer than
<tt>DSM_NAME_LENGTH</tt> characters,  as defined in <tt>dsm.h</tt>. 
</p>



<h4>structure definitions</h4>
Structure definitions create named composite data types which may be
used later in share definitions.  A structure definition begins with the
directive "structure&nbsp;&lt;name&gt;" which defines the name.  This is
followed by one or more allocation names (except those for other structures).
It ends with the directive "end_structure".  Example:
<pre>
structure DSM_TEST_1_X
  FIELD1_F
  FIELD2_L
  FIELD3_C20
  FIELD4_V10_S 
  FIELD5_V24_C24
end_structure
</pre>
The structure "DSM_TEST_1_X" contains five elements: a 4-byte float, a
long integer, a 20 character string, an array of 10 short integers, and
an array of 24 character strings each of length 24.

<h4>share definitions</h4>
Share definitions describe how data are actually shared between
computers.  A share definition begins with the directive "share",
followed by two class names.  One or more allocation names then appear
on subsequent lines.  This
creates a shared space for every pair of hostnames formed between class1
and class2.  For example, using the classes <tt>CL1</tt> and
<tt>CL2</tt> defined above:

<pre>
share CL1 CL2
  DSM_VAL_F
  DSM_QTY_L
  DSM_VEC_V10_S
  DSM_TEST_1_X
</pre>
Since each class contains two host names, this share definition
allocates four independent shared spaces:<br>
<pre>
  host1 - host3
  host1 - host4
  host2 - host3
  host2 - host4
</pre>

Each of these pairs shares four allocations: a float, a long integer, an
array of 10 short integers, and a structure.  It is important to note
that these four spaces are independent; e.g. changing the value of the
<tt>host1-host3</tt> copy of <tt>DSM_VAL_F</tt> changes it only in that
copy.  The <tt>DSM_VAL_F</tt> values in the <tt>host1-host4</tt>,
<tt>host2-host3</tt>, and <tt>host2-host4</tt> spaces are unaffected.
This exclusively pairwise sharing is due to the design of DSM to mimic
reflective memory functionality.

<p>
If a host name appears in both classes in a share definition, a shared
space will be created that is available only within that host.

<hr><a name="client"><h2>Client API</h2></a>

<p>To access DSM, a program #includes the header file
<tt>$GLOBALINC/dsm.h</tt> and links with 
<pre>
-L$COMMONLIB -ldsm -lrpc -lnetinet  (LynxOS)

-L$COMMONLIB -ldsm -lpthread -lrt   (Linux)
</pre>
This makes available a number of DSM functions and data structures.  Most of
the functions return a status code of type <tt>int</tt>, described in <a
href="#returncodes">Return Codes</a>.

<hr><a name="diagnostics"><h2>Diagnostic Facilities</h2></a>
<p>The DSM server provides diagnostic output for debugging.  It may be
activated two ways:
<ul>
<li>Specify the <tt>-v</tt> switch on the command line, which causes
diagnostic output to be sent to <tt>stderr</tt>.
<li>Send <tt>SIGUSR1</tt> to the running process.  This will cause
debugging output to be written to the file <tt>dsm_log.&lt;time&gt;</tt> where
<tt>time</tt> is the time the file was opened, in Unix timestamp form.
Another <tt>SIGUSR1</tt> stops the output and closes the file. 
If the server was started with the <tt>-v</tt> switch, then
<tt>SIGUSR1</tt> toggles diagnostic output off/on to <tt>stderr</tt>.
</ul>
<b>NOTE:</b> Activating diagnostic output severely degrades the
performance of the server, and should only be used for controlled debugging.
</p>
<p>The DSM package includes a suite of test programs in the
<tt>test/</tt> directory, with executables in architecture-specific
directories below that.  These programs are for engineering tests and
debugging. Many of them, when run with no arguments, provide a usage
summary.  They are poorly written, even more poorly documented, and
potentially dangerous to DSM.  Casual use is not recommended.
